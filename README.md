# Log Anomaly Detection Using Google Generative AI

This Python project detects anomalies in log entries using embeddings generated by Google Generative AI and clusters them with K-Means. Anomalous log entries are identified based on their distance from the cluster centers.

## Features

- Uses Google Generative AI to generate text embeddings.
- Clusters the embeddings using K-Means to detect anomalies.
- Identifies anomalies in system logs by comparing distances from cluster centers.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MyFaduGame/log-anomaly-detection.git
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install google-generativeai scikit-learn numpy
```

3. Set up your Google Generative AI API key in the code:

```python
gemini.configure(api_key="your-api-key")
```

Replace `"your-api-key"` with your actual Google Generative AI API key.

## Usage

1. Define your log entries in the script's `log_entries` list.

2. Run the script:

```bash
python log_anomaly_detection.py
```

3. The output will indicate which log entries are normal and which ones are anomalies:

### Example

#### Input Logs:
```plaintext
User login successful from IP 192.168.1.1
Failed login attempt from IP 10.0.0.5
Server error: CPU overload at 100% its over heated
Disk space running low on server
User logout from IP 192.168.1.1
everything is okay.
```

#### Output:
```plaintext
Log entry normal: User login successful from IP 192.168.1.1
Anomaly detected in log entry: Failed login attempt from IP 10.0.0.5
Anomaly detected in log entry: Server error: CPU overload at 100% its over heated
Anomaly detected in log entry: Disk space running low on server
Log entry normal: User logout from IP 192.168.1.1
Log entry normal: everything is okay.
```
